# RGB Colour Challenge

This application produces an image in which each colour occurs exactly once with no repetition and no unused colours.
Colours are made up of three components - red,
green, and blue. Each colour component is broken into 32 steps — 8, 16, 24 .. 256 — resulting in a pallette of 32,768 discrete colours to utilise.
